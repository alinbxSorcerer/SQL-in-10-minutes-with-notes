* Lesson 9. Summarizing Data

In this lesson, you will learn what the SQL aggregate functions are and how to use them to summarize table data.

** Using Aggregate Functions

It is often necessary to summarize data without actually retrieving it all, and SQL provides special functions for this purpose. Using these functions, SQL queries are often used to retrieve data for analysis and reporting purposes. Examples of this type of retrieval are

1. Determining the number of rows in a table (or the number of rows that meet some condition or contain a specific value).
2. Obtaining the sum of a set of rows in a table.
3. Finding the highest, lowest, and average values in a table column (either for all rows or for specific rows).

In each of these examples, you want a summary of the data in a table, not the actual data itself. Therefore, returning the actual table data would be a waste of time and processing resources (not to mention bandwidth). To repeat, all you really want is the summary information.

To facilitate this type of retrieval, SQL features a set of five aggregate functions, which are listed in Table 9.1. These functions enable you to perform all the types of retrieval just enumerated. You'll be relieved to know that unlike the data manipulation functions in the last lesson, SQL's aggregate functions are supported pretty consistently by the major SQL implementations.

The use of each of these functions is explained in the following sections.

*** The AVG() Function


AVG() is used to return the average value of a specific column by counting both the number of rows in the table and the sum of their values. AVG() can be used to return the average value of all columns or of specific columns or rows.

This first example uses AVG() to return the average price of all the products in the Products table:


#+BEGIN_SRC sql :engine mysql :dbuser org :database grocer
select avg(prod_price) as avg_price from Products;
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| avg_price |
|-----------|
|  6.823333 |
# 可以缩写为avg
The SELECT statement above returns a single value, avg_price that contains the average price of all products in the Products table. avg_price is an alias as explained in Lesson 7, "Creating Calculated Fields."

AVG() can also be used to determine the average value of specific columns or rows. The following example returns the average price of products offered by a specific vendor:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql :engine mysql :dbuser org :database grocer
select vend_id, avg(prod_price) as avg_price
from Products
where vend_id = "DLL01";
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| vend_id | avg_price |
|---------+-----------|
| DLL01   |  3.865000 |

This SELECT statement differs from the previous one only in that this one contains a WHERE clause. The WHERE clause filters only products with a vendor_id of DLL01, and, therefore, the value returned in avg_price is the average of just that vendor's products.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Caution: Individual Columns Only*

  AVG() may only be used to determine the average of a specific numeric column, and that column name must be specified as the function parameter. To obtain the average value of multiple columns, multiple AVG() functions must be used.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Note: NULL Values*

  Column rows containing NULL values are ignored by the AVG() function.
#+END_QUOTE

*** The COUNT() Function

COUNT() does just that: It counts. Using COUNT(), you can determine the number of rows in a table or the number of rows that match a specific criterion.

COUNT() can be used two ways:

- Use COUNT(*) to count the number of rows in a table, whether columns contain values or NULL values.
- Use COUNT(column) to count the number of rows that have values in a specific column, ignoring NULL values.

#+BEGIN_SRC sql :engine mysql :dbuser org :database grocer
select count(*) as num_cust
from Customers;
#+END_SRC
# num_cust把num放在了前面.
#+RESULTS:
| num_cust |
|----------|
|        5 |

In this example, COUNT(*) is used to count all rows, regardless of values. The count is returned in num_cust.

The following example counts just the customers with an e-mail address:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql :engine mysql :dbuser org :database grocer
select count(cust_email) as num_cust
from Customers;
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| num_cust |
|----------|
|        3 |

This SELECT statement uses COUNT(cust_email) to count only rows with a value in the cust_email column. In this example, cust_email is 3 (meaning that only 3 of the 5 customers have email addresses).

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Note: NULL Values*

  Column rows with NULL values in them are ignored by the COUNT() function if a column name is specified, but not if the asterisk (*) is used.
#+END_QUOTE

*** The MAX() Function

MAX() returns the highest value in a specified column. MAX() requires that the column name be specified, as seen here:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql :engine mysql :dbuser org :database grocer
select max(prod_price) as max_price
from Products;
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| max_price |
|-----------|
|     11.99 |

Here MAX() returns the price of the most expensive item in Products table.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Tip: Using MAX() with Non-Numeric Data*

  Although MAX() is usually used to find the highest numeric or date values, many (but not all) DBMSs allow it to be used to return the highest value in any columns including textual columns. When used with textual data, MAX() returns the row that would be the last if the data were sorted by that column.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Note: NULL Values*

  Column rows with NULL values in them are ignored by the MAX() function.
#+END_QUOTE

*** The MIN() Function

MIN() does the exact opposite of MAX();, it returns the lowest value in a specified column. Like MAX(), MIN() requires that the column name be specified, as seen here:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql :engine mysql :dbuser org :database grocer
select min(prod_price) as min_price
from Products;
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| min_price |
|-----------|
|      3.49 |

Here MIN() returns the price of the least expensive item in Products table.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Tip: Using MIN() with Non-Numeric Data*

  Although MIN() is usually used to find the lowest numeric or date values, many (but not all) DBMSs allow it to be used to return the lowest value in any columns including textual columns. When used with textual data, MIN() will return the row that would be first if the data were sorted by that column.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Note: NULL Values*

  Column rows with NULL values in them are ignored by the MIN() function.
#+END_QUOTE

*** The SUM()


Function SUM() is used to return the sum (total) of the values in a specific column.

Here is an example to demonstrate this. The OrderItems table contains the actual items in an order, and each item has an associated quantity. The total number of items ordered (the sum of all the quantity values) can be retrieved as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql :engine mysql :dbuser org :database grocer
select sum(quantity) as items_ordered
from OrderItems
where order_num = 20005;
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| items_ordered |
|---------------|
|           200 |

The function SUM(quantity) returns the sum of all the item quantities in an order, and the WHERE clause *ensures* that just the right order items are included.

SUM() can also be used to *total calculated values*. In this next example the total order amount is retrieved by totaling item_price*quantity for each item:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql :engine mysql :dbuser org :database grocer
select sum(item_price*quantity) as total_price
from OrderItems
where order_num = 20005;
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| total_price |
|-------------|
|     1648.00 |
# 还可以这样玩呀.

The function SUM(item_price*quantity) returns the sum of all the expanded prices in an order, and again the WHERE clause ensures that just the right order items are included.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Tip: Performing Calculations on Multiple Columns*

  All the aggregate functions can be used to perform calculations on multiple columns using the standard mathematical operators, as shown in the example.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Note: NULL Values*

  Column rows with NULL values in them are ignored by the SUM() function
#+END_QUOTE

** Aggregates on Distinct Values

The five aggregate functions can all be used in two ways:

- To perform calculations on all rows, specify the ALL argument or specify no argument at all (because ALL is the default behavior).
- To only include unique values, specify the DISTINCT argument.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Tip: ALL Is Default*

  The ALL argument need not be specified because it is the default behavior. If DISTINCT is not specified, ALL is assumed.
#+END_QUOTE

The following example uses the AVG() function to return the average product price offered by a specific vendor. It is the same SELECT statement used above, but here the DISTINCT argument is used so that the average only takes into account *unique prices:*

#+BEGIN_SRC sql :engine mysql :dbuser org :database grocer
select avg(distinct prod_price) as avg_price
from Products
where vend_id = "DLL01";
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| avg_price |
|-----------|
|  4.240000 |

As you can see, in this example avg_price is higher when DISTINCT is used because there are multiple items with the same lower price. Excluding them raises the average price.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  **Caution: No DISTINCT With COUNT(*)**

  DISTINCT may only be used with COUNT() if a column name is specified. DISTINCT may not be used with COUNT(*). Similarly, DISTINCT must be used with a column name and not with a calculation or expression.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Tip: Using DISTINCT with MIN() and MAX()*

  Although DISTINCT can technically be used with MIN() and MAX(), there is actually no value in doing so. The minimum and maximum values in a column will be the same whether or not only distinct values are included.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Note: Additional Aggregate Arguments*

  In addition to the DISTINCT and ALL arguments shown here, some DBMSs support additional arguments such as TOP and TOP PERCENT that let you perform calculations on subsets of query results. Refer to your DBMS documentation to determine exactly what arguments are available to you.
#+END_QUOTE

** Combining Aggregate Functions

All the examples of aggregate function used thus far have involved a single function. But actually, SELECT statements may contain as few or as many aggregate functions as needed. Look at this example:

#+BEGIN_SRC sql :engine mysql :dbuser org :database grocer
select count(*) as num_items,
min(prod_price) as min_price,
max(prod_price) as max_price,
avg(prod_price) as avg_price
from Products;
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| num_items | min_price | max_price | avg_price |
|-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------|
|         9 |      3.49 |     11.99 |  6.823333 |

Here a single SELECT statement performs four aggregate calculations in one step and returns four values (the number of items in the Products table, and the highest, lowest, and average product prices).

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Caution: Naming Aliases*

  When specifying alias names to contain the results of an aggregate function, try to not use the name of an actual column in the table. Although there is nothing actually illegal about doing so, many SQL implementations do not support this and will generate obscure error messages if you do so.
#+END_QUOTE

** Summary

Aggregate functions are used to summarize data. SQL supports five aggregate functions, all of which can be used in multiple ways to return just the results you need. These functions are designed to be highly efficient, and they usually return results far more quickly than you could calculate them yourself within your own client application.
